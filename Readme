This is the lab3 repo

Program requires both the Client and Server programs to be running, therefore I'm starting the repo with a copy of lab1 (It has the same structure).





													Git commands:
/*
	Steps to developing a feature:
		- edit, stage, and commit

  - committing saves the change to your local repo
  - commits keep track of the history of all changes
	- once you want to merge all your commits to the central repo , use push
			origin master
*/

	// adds file (stages file) to be committed
git add file1
git commit -m "<message here>"

/* make sure the central repo's updates merge with your local repo
	w/o conflict.
	rebase adds change ontop of what everyone else has already done
	merges commits one by one and stops on conflicts
	can use git status and add to help resolve conflicts
	git rebase --abort to cancel the whole thing
*/
// use rebase to fetch from remote/central and add changes to head in local
										// add changes or merge or integrate central into local

git pull --rebase origin master

		// if only contributer or you've already pulled or rebased
		// this updates the central master branch to your version
git push origin master
