1. 5 TCP control packets are exchanged over the network when a new client connects to the server. The first packet is a SYN connection request packet from the client to the server. The second packet is a SYN, ACK packet that is an acknowledgement of the connection request that the server sends to the client. The third packet is an ACK packet that is the client acknowledging that it received the acknowledgement from the server. This completes the "three-way handshake". The fourth packet is a PSH, ACK packet that contains the information where the server is asking for the client to enter their name. The fifth packet is an ACK packet where the client is acknowledging this request.

2. The RTT for the SYN-ACK packet is 0.000030519 seconds. This is the number found in the "Time" column for the second packet that says [SYN, ACK] in the information column.

3. After clients have connected, given their names, and established a connection, four packets are exchanged when one client sends a message to another client. When one client leaves the chat program, three more packets are exchanged.

4. Two TCP control packets are exchanged when a client wants to join the chat server but no server is running. The first packet is a SYN request packet from the client. The second packet is an RST, ACK packet that comes back to the client since a connection was not established.
